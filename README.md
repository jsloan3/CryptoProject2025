**Instructions**

Before running, make sure to create a virtual environment using python's virtual environment package. On windows, this can be installed using:

`python -m venv venv`

Once this is done, the virtual environment can be activated using

`venv\scripts\activate.bat`

Once the virtual environment is activated, you should see `(venv)` in your terminal. Then you can install all needed libraries by typing

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

in the terminal and hitting enter. All needed libraries should be installed.
